Updates made from PCB layout/schematic to demo board

1. Add peripheral H Bridge board
  a. Cut trace from OSC to upper input of C-W generator
  b. Cut trace from GND to lower input of C-W generator
  c. Connect OSC, 12V, and GND to peripheral board inputs
  d. Connect inputs to C-W generator to corresponding outputs of peripheral board

Changes to H Bridge Oscillator PCB

1. Remove R4 (needed for simulations to run properly, but not necessary for real life circuit)
